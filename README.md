# DECENTRALIZED-AUTHENTICATION-FRAMEWORK-
A NOVEL DECENTRALIZED AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK WITH GEOLOCATION AND MFA ENABLED JWT FOR P2P SOCIAL NETWORK APPLICATIONS

 # INTRODUCTION
 P2POnlineSocialNetworks(P2POSNs)promoteprivacy,
 security, and user control, eliminating centralized data
 reliance.
 Decentralized networks face authentication and
 authorization challenges, including identity spoofing and
 Sybilattacks.
 The paper proposes a decentralized authentication
 frameworkusingAES-GCMencryption,SHA512withRSAfor
 signatures,andJWTforsessionmanagement.
 Multi-FactorAuthentication(MFA)withOTPandgeolocation
 enhancessecurity,preventingunauthorizedaccess.
 Future improvements includescalability throughdistributed
 cloudenvironmentsand integrationof biometricverification
 foraddedsecurity
