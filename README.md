# DECENTRALIZED-AUTHENTICATION-FRAMEWORK-
A NOVEL DECENTRALIZED AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK WITH GEOLOCATION AND MFA ENABLED JWT FOR P2P SOCIAL NETWORK APPLICATIONS

 # INTRODUCTION
 P2P Online SocialNetworks(P2POSNs) promote privacy,
 security, and user control, eliminating centralized data
 reliance.
 Decentralized networks face authentication and
 authorization challenges, including identity spoofing and
 Sybilattacks.
 The paper proposes a decentralized authentication
 frame work using AES-GCM encryption,SHA512withRSA for
 signatures,and JWT for sessionmanagement.
 Multi-Factor Authentication(MFA) with OTP and geolocation
 enhances security,preventing unauthorized access.
 Future improvements include scalability through distributed
 cloud environments and integrationof biometric verification
 for added security
